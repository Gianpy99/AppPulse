# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Project Name:** AppPulse  
**Owner:** Solo build (you)  
**Date:** 2025-08-14

## 1) Problem Statement
Users and small teams often struggle to monitor multiple app performance metrics (usage, crashes, engagement) in real time. Existing solutions are either too complex, expensive, or fragmented across multiple tools. There is a need for a lightweight, real-time monitoring app that provides actionable insights for apps and small projects.

---

## 2) Goals & Objectives
- **Real-time tracking** of app usage and performance metrics.  
- **Crash detection & reporting** with root cause analysis suggestions.  
- **Engagement insights** for feature adoption and retention.  
- **Simple dashboard** suitable for small teams or solo developers.  
- **Exportable reports** for stakeholders or project reviews.

---

## 3) Target Users
- Indie developers, small app teams.  
- Solo app creators or hobbyists.  
- Product managers needing lightweight app analytics.

---

## 4) Core Features

### MVP
1. **Dashboard** with app-specific metrics (sessions, active users).  
2. **Crash logging** with timestamps, device info, and stack traces.  
3. **Event tracking** (button clicks, key actions).  
4. **Notifications** for critical events (crashes, errors).  
5. **Exportable CSV/JSON reports**.

### Phase 2
6. **Trend charts** for engagement and retention.  
7. **Custom alerts** and thresholds.  
8. **Lightweight API** for integration with other dashboards.

### Phase 3
9. **AI-driven recommendations** for improving engagement.  
10. **Multi-app support** with consolidated dashboards.  
11. **Predictive crash analysis** based on historical data.

## 5) Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Dashboard updates every 10 seconds for MVP.  
- **Security:** User authentication and data isolation per app.  
- **Reliability:** ≥99% uptime; local caching for offline access.  
- **Accessibility:** Web-first design; mobile responsive.

---

## 6) Constraints
- Must support multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web).  
- Lightweight deployment for solo developers (minimal server overhead).  

---

## 7) Tech Stack Suggestion
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind or Vue.  
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python (FastAPI).  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB.  
- **Analytics:** Event tracking and aggregation using custom microservices.  
- **Notifications:** Webhooks or email alerts.

---

## 8) Success Metrics
- ≥80% user satisfaction with dashboard usability.  
- ≥50% users actively monitoring daily metrics.  
- Reduction in unresolved crash incidents by ≥30%.

---

## 9) Roadmap

| Phase     | Duration  | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **MVP**   | 4 weeks   | Dashboard, crash logging, event tracking, notifications |
| **Phase 2** | +4 weeks | Trend charts, custom alerts, API integration |
| **Phase 3** | +6 weeks | AI recommendations, multi-app support, predictive analysis |

---

## 10) Risks & Mitigation
- **Data overload:** Limit default tracking; allow user-configurable metrics.  
- **API limits:** Provide fallback local caching.  
- **Security:** Ensure encrypted storage and secure authentication.

---

## 11) Open Questions
- Should the platform **offer free tier** or subscription-only?  
- Which **notifications** are critical for MVP?  
- Level of **cross-platform support** required initially?
